<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buddy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is 8:20 at night and the car is sweaty; smells like Doritos and mold. The sun isn’t quite down yet, but it will be soon. Even with the AC going it feels sticky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are waiting outside of a three story apartment building, the kind with different paint on different sections so it doesn’t all look like one building. Even though it is. The sign reads -”The Villas: an affordable housing development.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the fuck does that mean?” I ask when we see the sign. I narrow my eyes, the heat makes it hard for me to be as mad as I want to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Angela looks it up - “It’s a place where they got lower rent because they don’t make enough money. They’re poor.” That was weird, for some reason I just thought everyone in Austin was rich.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Angela is smart with computers, she can fix them, knows how to set them up and she can find things. She found Buddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Found him by his little chip that I got him when he was just a puppy.&nbsp; Mom told me “Really? you're gonna spend all that money on a dog? Well I guess if you wanna waste your Dad’s money that’s your business.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I first took Buddy to the vet they had recommended all these things, vaccines, and pills for heart worms, and a chip right in his butt so if you ever lost him you could find him again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we did find him. In Austin, Texas. It’s a three and a half hour drive, but it’s worth it. The Elantra made it the whole way, no problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m going to fucking kill that bitch that took him. Tears prick my eyes, but I blink them back.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s my dog, it doesn’t matter what my mom thinks or anyone else. I’m going to get him back and take him home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dad bought him for me. My dad is like a real rich person. He lives in Galveston. In a house that he bought. There is a garage and big old kitchen, and 3 bedrooms. You can walk 3 blocks to the ocean. It’s beautiful. On my 16th birthday he bought me Buddy - a Shih Tzu. My mom called him a “Shit head,” with a fake little laugh. Like she was joking. She wasn’t joking. But I didn’t care. Buddy was mine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dad said he would take care of the food and vet bills and for a while he did, but you know. Life gets away from you. I guess he forgot. And I felt like shit asking because I know that mom was always asking him for money, so I didn’t want to double up.&nbsp; And I started working at Big Fish in my senior year anyway, so I could afford to buy Buddy’s food by then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom is always super jealous of anything, and Buddy drove her crazy. “I swear you love that dog more than you love me.” With that fake little laugh. And I’d have to say, “No, Mom you know he’s just a dumb dog.” That would make her feel better. But it always made me sad. I didn’t like saying he was dumb, even if he really kind of was. I guess he still is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t believe it when Angela told me she had found him. I guess she kind of had to hack something through the vet's office that she used to work at. I keep telling her she should get a computer job, because she’s really good at it. But she’s embarrassed that she dropped out of high school. She works sometimes, but she keeps getting fired.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom got super pissed off when Angela said she found him, but tried not to show it, “Oh good! You found him. Angela is always so lucky with computers! I can’t believe you still even remember that dog after all these years. What was his name? Bummy? Bunny?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buddy, Mom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, your little friend.” She took a deep breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you a little busy for a dog, now that you are an assistant manager at that fish place?” With that fake little laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to yell at her, tell her she was a bitch, but then she’d just yell back at me. It wasn’t worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s the one who took him to the pound in Brownwood. Fucking 53 miles away. She had to ask my Aunt for a ride because she don’t drive. How bad do you have to hate a dog to take him 53 miles away?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was my birthday, too. My 18th birthday. Dad had taken me for a whole trip to Galveston - I got to go to the beach and Moody Gardens and to the Schlitterbahn that they got there. We ate shrimp and crab cakes. It was the best week of my life, but when I got back Buddy was gone. Mom told me he had runoff, but my Aunt let me know the truth. I drove up to Brownwood to get him, but by that time they’d already taken him to Austin and someone had adopted him. There was no way I could get him back. That was 2 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see him coming out of the apartments. My heart thumps in my chest. I have to do a double take because he looks so good. His coat is shiny and his little tail is up. His tail is only up when he’s happy. But it’s him alright, same tan and white coat, same way of prancing, then he sneezes just like he always did and my heart nearly bursts out of my chest. Buddy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s beat the crap out of her and get him back!” Angela is already leaning towards the door handle. She doesn’t really care much about the dog, but she does like a fight. She likes to watch. That might even be why she found him for me. Mom and me fought all the time over Buddy. Maybe she just missed the yelling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! What? You fucking crazy? Right here, in front of her own apartment building? No way, Chica! Her neighbors would call the cops on us. Be patient for a minute.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I start the car and stalk her, staying back a little. I don’t want her to see us until she’s turned the corner. I turn a vent so that the AC blows directly on my face.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, she’s fat.” Angela is pissed when someone is more skinny than she is, and thinks she’s better than anyone who is fatter than her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, fat bitch. What does she need with my fucking dog!” But she isn’t really fat. She’s a little round, you know how like older ladies get. Not as fat as me. About as fat as Angela.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone in our house gains weight, it’s like the bad feelings just get into you and blow you up until you look as fat and mean as my mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Angela came to live with us 3 years ago, she’s my cousin, but my aunt needed a break. When she first came she was 15 and super cute. She gained a little weight and looked tight; High titties and a round butt. But then she just kept gaining. The boys stopped eyeing her. She didn’t even get cat calls on the street anymore. I know it made her depressed. Depressed and angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kind of felt sorry for her, but also, it felt good that I wasn’t the only one who blew up in that house. Like, maybe it wasn’t only me that’s this way. Maybe it was the house.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom always said it was because we didn’t have a lot of money. That never really tracked for me - like how would not having much money make you fatter. But I saw a headline that said “Poverty is linked to obesity,” so I guess she was right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once in health class they gave us this recipe for granola. It was supposed to be a super healthy way to start your day. I asked mom if she could make it. But she got so pissed off. “Monica! Are you suddenly a princess? I’m supposed to wait on you hand and foot, like I’m your maid. I don’t think so Chica!” Fake laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to make it, but I wasn’t very good at it. Mom watched over me the whole time giving me suggestions and telling me what I was messing up. So even though it ended up tasting good, I don’t know. It wasn’t really worth the effort. We usually ate Eggos or sausage biscuits for breakfast. It was faster anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lady and Buddy move slowly down the street. She looks like a nice lady. But you can tell she doesn’t have a lot of money, even from here. She has cut off jeans that are too tight for her - her chub rub probably blew out the inner thighs on her cheap Old Navy jeans and she turned them into shorts. Her shoes look like Payless Keds. You know, cheap as shit. Probably makes that “flap-flap” sound with every step. She walks with her head up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time Buddy stops to pee she turns back and smiles at him. She has a nice smile. She says something that we can’t hear because the windows are rolled up.&nbsp; But I can tell it’s something nice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why the fuck would she do that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first I would take Buddy out for a walk every night. It was nice. A little time just walking around the neighborhood. Seeing the people who lived on our block. Smelling the fresh air.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then my mom was all like “He’s got you wrapped around his little finger. You spoil that dog to shit, Monica. Just let him out back.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The back was nasty and weedy but it was true, why couldn’t he just pee out there. It was easier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom hated Buddy because he would pee inside the house when I was at school. I kept telling her she needed to let him out, but she just said, “I’m not a doorman for a DOG. I’m not his maid. He’s gotta learn how to hold it. If I let him out all the time he’s just gonna get lazy. I have got work to do.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was true. My mom runs an Etsy shop. She makes these little bracelets and necklaces and earrings. She engraves them and they say things like “Best Mom In The World.” Or “Daughters Make Life Sweet.” It doesn’t bring in a ton of money, I have to buy a lot of the groceries. But still, it keeps a roof over our heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So he’d pee in the house. And mom would just yell at him. And when I got home I’d have to put his nose in it and make him smell it and then smack his butt and throw him outside. I didn’t like doing that, but he had to learn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our house still smells bad, but I don’t think it’s from the pee anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately when I get home from the Big Fish, I can’t even go inside. Like I sit in the car telling myself that I have to go inside, but I can’t. I just sit there for like 10 minutes, until something sort of breaks inside me and I finally get up and get my fat ass inside the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly Buddy stops. The lady keeps walking but Buddy sits down. She has one of those leashes that go out a really long way out and then snaps back in. She goes all the way to the end and then stops and turns around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My stomach clenches. Fuck! If she beats my dog I’m gonna have to kick her ass. I don’t care about her neighbors or the cops or anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my head I hear my mom yelling - I can’t even hear the words. I don’t even know who she is yelling at, but the yelling rings in my ears. The car is stifling even with the AC blowing right in my face. My chest is tight, my stomach drops, I really want a red vine right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the lady doesn’t yell, and she doesn’t beat him. She comes over and squats down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Angela scoffs, “Ha, look at her fat thighs!”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shorts are too tight and will probably leave marks, but she doesn’t seem to care.&nbsp; She reaches out and holds Buddy’s paw. She feels one and then the other. Then she pulls on something. It comes out and she throws it back into the grass.&nbsp; My stomach unclenches and I feel so sad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sticker bur. She pulls a fucking sticker bur out of Buddy’s paw like she’s his mama or something. Then she pats his head and says something with that nice lady smile of hers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh nasty, she touched his feet,” sneers Angela.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah,” I say chewing the red vine. “Nasty.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I am 7 years old. My dad has left and I am all alone with Mom. I drop a glass and it breaks all over the kitchen floor. My mom yells at me to get a broom and clean it up. As I try to sweep I get broken glass in my feet, in my hands. I start to bleed and mom gets even more angry because I’m bleeding on the floor. I cry and hold my hand out for help. But mom just says I have to pull the glass out myself. I have to learn. And it hurts so much.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buddy walks with his tail high. Sometimes in front of the lady, sometimes behind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I speed up near the corner so I can follow them around.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lady is clearly walking around the block, and once they turn again we can jump her. I want to jump her. I love Buddy so much. I want to take him home and brush his fur and take him for walks. I want to be nice to him. I want to care for him like this lady does. I love him so much.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never told my dad what happened to Buddy. I don’t know why, I just couldn’t quite admit to him that my mom would do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We turn a second corner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monica, if we jump her now, no one will see,” Angela whispers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s true too. We are behind her building now, but it’s mostly warehouses here and the workers have gone home. It’d be real easy to kick her ass. There are two of us. And she is older.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can just see her, at first she’d be all sweet and say “Hi” and “How are you doing?” until we got too close. Then she’d get all feisty like older ladies do. She’d do whatever she could to save her dog, too. You can tell. She’d give us hell for sure. Maybe even give us some bruises. We might have to break something. Hear her bones go crunch. Then we’d take Buddy. And she’d start crying and begging for us to bring her dog back.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buddy would look at me and recognize me and he’d lick my nose. He only ever licked my nose because I was the only one he loved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Angela would say “Nasty, that dog licks his butt and then you let him lick your nose.” But fuck her.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we’d put Buddy into the car and drive away and the woman couldn’t do anything about it because she is old and poor and fat and we are younger and faster and meaner than her.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as we drove away Buddy would look out the window at her, but it wouldn’t matter because he was my dog first and he would love me again. He would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull up on the other side of the street and stop the car. With the engine off I can smell some nasty industrial smell. I taste acid in the back of my mouth. The heat is suffocating. I can’t make myself move. I just stare at them as they are walking away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Buddy sits down. No reason, the asshole dog just sits. He used to do that all the time. It drove me crazy. Just sit there and I’d have to drag his ass and he’d cough and choke, but he wouldn’t get up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wait for the lady to drag him, but instead she comes over and makes a little sign. His tail wags and she gently and carefully picks up the tiny dog like he is precious to her. She holds him close in her arms so she can carry him the rest of the way home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Man, that dog is lazy,” scoffs Angela.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun has just sunk below the horizon. They are silhouetted against a pink and purple sky.&nbsp; She kisses his ear and pulls back to look at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buddy reaches forward and licks her nose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They turn the corner and are gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart shatters into a million pieces. No one has ever been that kind to me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel tears prick my eyes - I have to blink them back or Angela will shame me forever.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you waiting for? Let’s get him!” Angela wants this fight. But she can’t start it. She wants me to get out of the car and take the lead so that she can follow. She can’t make any move on her own. That’s why she’s always getting fired. She has to follow someone else, mostly she follows the wrong people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clench the tears back down. I pull a chunk from a red vine and say “That dog was such a pain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Angela is confused for a moment, but she always follows and sometimes that’s useful. “Yeah, kind of a shit head.” She laughs her own fake laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clamp my heart down to keep it from jumping away. “I mean, that lady is fucking spoiling his little ass, he’ll be rotten by now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My fingers are so tight on the steering wheel that they turn white and I focus on that pain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you see the way he just sat down and the lady picked him up. Like she was his maid?” I clench my jaw down on the red vine as I feel its acrid sweetness flood my mouth. If I let it go even enough to chew the anger will turn to sadness and I’ll drown.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah,” says Angela. “That dog is probably spoiled to shit by now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod; she smiles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you work all the time anyway. Now that you made </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">assistant </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">manager. It’s like your mom said, you don’t really have the time for a dog anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me being an assistant manager is a huge joke in our house. I don’t know why; I make $18 an hour. And I have benefits and vacation. It’s more than any of them make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuck that dumb dog and that lady,” I say as I start the car again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah,” says Angela. “Fuck them.” She’s still pumped up from the fight that didn’t happen. She keeps muttering to herself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the car into gear and start back towards I35.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I don’t even think the words before I say them, but as soon as they come out of my mouth I know they are true.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m gonna move out on my own.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun is down now. The lights on the buildings downtown look real pretty. The car finally starts to cool down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
