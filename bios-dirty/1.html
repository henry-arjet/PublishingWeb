<p>Serif fonts are the ones with the little curly bits that appear on each letter. For example on the letter &lsquo;I&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll either have curly sticky out bits on the top and bottom or you won&rsquo;t. If you do, then it is a serif font. If you don&rsquo;t then it is a sans serif font. The term &lsquo;Sans-Serif&rsquo; comes from the French word &lsquo;Sans&rsquo; which means without. Literally, it means &lsquo;without the curly bits&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now, that is in layman&rsquo;s terms. I&rsquo;m sure a professional typographer would whack me over the head if he heard me talking about curly bits, but hopefully this description has helped you to understand the difference.</p>
<p>Now, how does this help you when designing header graphics and web pages in general. Well, the general consensus is that sans-serif fonts such as Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, and Tahoma, are the most appropriate to use in the body of a web page. The reason for this is interlaced monitors may show what is known as &lsquo;twittering&rsquo; on the fine details of the serif fonts. In plain English, computer displays can struggle with the small curly bits on serif fonts, whereas Sans-Serif fonts display much clearer as there are no curly bits to struggle with.</p>
